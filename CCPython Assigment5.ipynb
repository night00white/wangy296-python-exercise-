These can be things like registered classes, graduation year, enrollment status, etc. Anything you can think of! Class flexibility is designed so that your approach reflects your own personal understanding of the problem. But for a more structured challenge read on...\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenges here extend the functionality of the base class. These are in topics of class attributes, magic methods, inheritance, and iteration. Don't be afraid to check python documentation on these problems to look for implementation help! No one codes alone!\n",
    "\n",
    "Class is where your own ideas get to come through as a programmer and designer. So there is no one right way to any of these. Give it your best shot and also be creative!\n",
    "\n",
    "Challenge #1 add an class wide attribute student count and give every student an ID Create a Class wide count of students that tracks how many students have been created. Then, usi that attriute to give every student a unique ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "Challenge #2 add a behavioral method to the students What kind of behavior should a student have? What do they do? Do they study? Research? Maybe a student can declare a major or focus of study?\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement the method and the appropriate attributes that allows a student to print a statement about themselves. These can be as simple as \"say my own name\" or something like printing the student's favorite faculty member\n",

    "Challenge #3 create a subclass called Graduate Student The Graduate student should inherit from the base Student class. How do you think Graduate Students should be differentiated from the base Student? Add your own attribute or methods that you think they should have.\n",

    "Challenge #4 Create a School Class that has Students as attributes This is a separate class that is called School that can enroll Students, and graduate students. Maybe it can track its own endowment. This would be a large class that is meant to process these students in some way."
